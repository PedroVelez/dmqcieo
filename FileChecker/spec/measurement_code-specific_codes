101 | DM Traj file only | This MC is used in the DM Traj file when new cycles have been recovered during DM operations ( the TECH file, where surface pressure measurements usually belong, is not updated during TRAJ DM).
203 | | Deepest bin reached during descending profile
301 | | Representative Park <PARAM> found either from measurements taken during drift or from metafile information
501 | | Down-time end time: end date of the down-time parameter reported by APEX floats
502 | | Ascent start time directly transmitted by APEX floats
503 | | Deepest bin reached during ascending profile
602 | AET | Time of MC=701 minus 10 minutes
701 | | Transmission start time directly transmitted by APEX float
702 | FMT | Earliest time of all messages received by telecommunications system . may or may not have a location fix.  Time (JULD_FIRST_MESSAGE)
703 | | Surface times and locations (if available) during surface drift. Should be listed in chronological order.
704 | LMT | Latest time of all messages received by telecommunications system . may or may not have a location fix.  Time (JULD_LAST_MESSAGE)
901 | | Grounded flag. Configuration phase
902 | | Last time before float recovery. For floats that have been recovered, it is important to know when this occurred. This time in the JULD array will be the last time before the float was recovered. Determined by inspection of data
903 | | Pressure offset used to correct APEX pressure measurements
