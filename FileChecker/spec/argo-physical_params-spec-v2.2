// Special codes:
//    "<->" attribute cannot exist; "<*>" attribute optional, value ignored; <+> attribute must exist, value is ignored

// Special settings:
// Define some additional specialized attribute settings
// They are NOT free-form.  That is the Java parsing code has specific names that are hard-coded.

ADJUSTED_ERROR:comment | Contains the error on the adjusted values as determined by the delayed mode QC process.
PRES:axis | <-> |
PRES_ADJUSTED:axis | <-> |

// Parameter specifications:
// Version 2.2 and earlier, there was an attribute "comment" and no attribute "standard_name"
// Therefore, the 4th column is used for "comment"
// Also, all parameters were "core" -- the "c" in the category column

//type | param | long_name | comment | units | valid_min | valid_max | category(c,b,i)
