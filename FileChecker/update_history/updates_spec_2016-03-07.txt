Update to "Configuration parameter names for metadata files, core Argo, February 3rd 2016"

Update to the Feb 5th version of: Argo physical parameters list: Core-Argo and B-Argo
- needs to be updated on the ADMT website!

Update to ArgoTechnicalParameterNames-v7.4.xlsx
- needs to be updated on the ADMT website!

Update to current versions of:
  reference table 23
  reference table 27

NOTE: The tech_units table was updated recently on the ADMT site but the FileChecker
      has been using this version for a while


Changes to physical parameters:

type | name | long_name | cf_standard_name | unit | valid_min | valid_max | core/bio/intermediate

Changed:
float | PPOX_DOXY | Partial pressure of oxygen | <-> | millibar | -5.f | 5000.f | i

Added:
float | TEMP_PH | Sea temperature from pH sensor | <-> | degree_Celsius | -2.f | 40.f | i
float | IB_PH | Base current of pH sensor | <-> | nanoampere | <-> | <-> | i
float | TILT | Inclination of the float axis in respect to the local vertical | <-> | degree | <-> | <-> | i

The "<->" means the FileChecker doesn't check the settings.
                                                                         ^^^^^^
