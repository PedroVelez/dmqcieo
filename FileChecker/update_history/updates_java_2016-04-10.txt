!!!!!!!!!!!   CHANGE OF REVISION FROM 2.3 to 2.4   !!!!!!!!!!


SUMMARY
=======

Add "GDAC file name" validation to FileChecker (used to be a separate check at each GDAC)

Add capability to WARN (or NOWARN) when an attribute is using a deprecated setting
during a "transition" 
- implemented via the "attr_regex" spec-file
- currently being used to transition the valid_min/valid_max values of
    DOXY:valid_min = 0.0;           WARN 
    DOXY_ADJUSTED:valid_min = 0.0;  WARN
    DOXY_STD:valid_min = 0.0;       WARN
    DOXY_MED:valid_min = 0.0;       WARN

    C2PHASE_DOXY:valid_min = 10.0;  WARN
    C2PHASE_DOXY:valid_max = 70.0;  WARN
    C2PHASE_DOXY_ADJUSTED:valid_min = 10.0; WARN
    C2PHASE_DOXY_ADJUSTED:valid_max = 70.0; WARN
    C2PHASE_DOXY_MED:valid_min = 10.0;      WARN
    C2PHASE_DOXY_MED:valid_max = 70.0;      WARN

Add meta-data CONFIG_PARAMETER_NAME unit checking (using the tech-unit list)

Make testing for FillValue more explicit for "physical parameter" data (profile files)
- simple less-than/greater-than checking of FillValue is failing on some ill-advised
  values where non-missing data can be greater than the FillValue

<PARAM>_STD: valid_min, valid_max are no longer required
- *** interesting technicality:  in e-mail discussion the decision was that these 
  parameters should not be allowed for these variables.
  EXCEPT that at ADMT-16 it was decided that extra (undocumented) attributes
  are allowed -- the FileChecker doesn't check for them and doesn't reject them.
  So, if someone provides these attributes they are just considered "extra attributes"
  and they are allowed. Therefore, in practice, they are just "not required".
- *** the required attribute settings should be defined in the "physical parameter list".
  This list states that <PARAM>_STD and <PARAM>_MED are allowed but it does NOT
  say anything about the required attributes for these variables.


Check that PARAM_ADJUSTED and PARAM_ADJUSTED_ERROR have the same number of
levels set in D-mode profile files

Allow PARAM_ADJUSTED_ERROR to be set in A-mode for bio-parameters

Date check changes:
- Removed test (warning) of DATE_UPDATE within 3 days of GDAC submit date - all files
- Meta-data: 
  - Make LAUNCH_DATE mandatory (previously documented this way but code wasn't
    enforcing it)
  - Remove check that compares START_DATE to LAUNCH_DATE
- Profile:
  - allow JULD and JULD_LOCATION to differ by 2 days (instead of 1)
  - if JULD_LOCATION is missing POSITION must be missing
     (used to have another check on POSITION_QC)

Trajectory Files:
- implement meta-data and reasonable date checks
- implement TRAJECTORY_PARAMETERS checks
- N_MEASUREMENT variables and N_CYCLE variables are NOT checked (yet)
