Summary
=======

The primary purpose for moving from v2.4 to v2.5 is to implement
trajectory file data consistency checks.  

The initial deployment of v2.5 will have these checks turned off.
There is no change to the results between this deployment and the
last release of v2.4.

Minor change to ValidateSubmit arguments:
- the "format-only-pre-v3.1" option is now the default
  - this option is deprecated but is still accepted for
    backwards compatibility
- new argument "data-check-all" to force al files to be data checked

Details

ValidateSubmit.java
===================
- make "format-only-pre-v3.1" the default
  - argument still accepted for backwards compatibility
- add "data-check-all" argument to force all files to be data checked



ArgoDataFile.java
=================
- Change name of isPhysParamFillValue to is_99_999_FillValue
  - just make it more generic

- Add "returnNulls" option to the readString(...) methods

- Add new readString(var, n, m, returnNulls) case


ArgoProfileFile.java
====================

- Have stringRead(...) return nulls for a bunch of reads
  - ensures one-to-one correspondence with other arrays
- Switch to new "is fill value" method names


ArgoReferenceTable
==================
- remove "2 column" requirement on all reference tables
  - will properly read and parse 1 or 2 or more column tables

- add readMapCharString method
  - adopt method instead of doing direct reads

- add readMapIntegerString method

- add read of reference tables 5, 19, 20

- add reads of "measurement code" tables



ArgoTrajectoryFile.java
=======================
- massive change to most everything it does which is why it is
  changing to v2.5


WriteMergeProfile.java
======================
- major re-write.  now creates variables and attributes by copying them from the
  core- and/or bio-file.
