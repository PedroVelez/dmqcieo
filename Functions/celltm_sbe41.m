% 
% Given a profile of SBE-41 (or SBE-41CP) data consisting of salinity
% (salt, pss-78), temperature (temp, deg. C, ITPS-68), pressure (pres,
% dbar), and the elapsed time of the samples (e_time, seconds), this
% function returns a corrected salinity (salt_cor, pss-78).
% 
% The elapsed time (e_time) must to be estimated using different methods
% for different models of float, and must reflect the time elapsed in
% seconds since the start of the profile for each samples.
% 
% For Apex 260 floats with the "maintain a minumum ascent rate of 0.08 m/s
% controllers" data from Dana Swift (UW) suggest a mean rise rate of 0.09
% dbar/second (with a standard deviation of +/- 0.015 dbar/s, and actual
% values ranging between about 0.06 and 0.12 dbar/s) should be used to
% derive elapsed time from pressure.
%
% Users of other floats should estimate their ascent rates and use these
% estimates to compute an e_time in seconds.
%
% Estimates of alpha and tau=1/beta following Morrison et al, (1994, JAOT)
% are also required.
%
% For SBE-41 CTDs I have estimated alpha = 0.0267 and tau = 18.6 s using
% data from PMEL and UW Apex floats equipped with SBE-41 CTDs.
% 
% For SBE-41CP CTDs I estimated alpha = 0.141 and tau = 6.68 s using using 
% 1 Hz data in Arctic ocean thermohaline staircases from three Ice-Tethered 
% profilers (ITPs) with ascent rates of about 0.27 dbar/s.  NOTE THAT SINCE 
% THE FLOATS USUALLY ASCEND SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN THE ITPS, THESE 
% COEFFICIENTS MAY NOT QUITE BE OPTIMAL FOR SBE-41CP CTDS ON FLOATS!
% 
% Note that routine is designed for vectors only from a single profile, not
% matrices.
%
% Note that the data (and the e_time) should be passed to this routine in
% the order that they were collected (sorted to go from deepest pressure to
% shallowest).
%
% Note that park data should not be corrected (and thus not passed through
% this routine) since the CTD should be in thermal equilibrium when at
% park.
%
% Note that the ucertainty in the correction is about the size of the
% correction itself.  This uncertainty should be treated as an independent
% error from other sources of error (such as the manufacturer's calibration
% uncertainty  and/or WJO/BS conductivity slope adjustment from historical
% T-S relationships) and thus should be combined in quadrature (square any
% relevant error terms, sum these squares, and then take the square root of
% the sum) for inclusion in psal_adjusted_error.
%
% Note that the CSIRO seawater toolkit is required for use of this function.
%
% Use this function at your own risk.  The author takes no responsibility
% for errors or omissions, but will be happy to receive suggestions for
% improvements or corrections so that they can be reviewed, implimented if
% warranted, and passed on to others.  Users should e-mail the author so
% that they can receive notice of any updates.
